About .5 miles into your hike to your favorite climbing rock you come across a person laying on the ground who has suffered a fall from a height of about 10 feet while bouldering.  An onlooker says they landed on their back and legs. To begin, select who you want to talk with, by selecting Dispatch or Patient from the dropdown menu. Thanks for your help with the hiker.
