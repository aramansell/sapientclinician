This assessment will capture your thought process and critial thinking as you attempt to diagnose a patient.

To begin, create your first Note. After it is sent, select who you want to talk with, by selecting Clinician, Patient or submitting orders to the Lab from the dropdown menu. 

After several interactions with the Patient, Clinician or Lab you must submit your Diagnosis.


Your first note should be your initial thoughts about the patient, Jane, whom the ER doctor would like your help consulting on. She is a 34 year old with leukocytosis.
